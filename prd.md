I need to develop a UI and animation library for a custom art project, 
you can see the technical equipment in the equipment.md


the Board + 3 Axis Accelerometer drive the LED strip, which is located in a large tube running back and forth to make 3 segments.
Between those are 3 mirrors making a triangle inside the tube and sort of an ifinity mirror effetc.
at one end of the tube is a large magnifiing glass and the other end a person looks through to see the LEDs etc

this tube is then mounted ona tripod with the ability to til up and down and trun side to side.


I want to have a bunch of animation that react to the motion of the tube and the angles that its at. so like change the color of a sparkley animatin, or the speed etc.


I'm not sure if MPU6050 is the right board for this type of application.
